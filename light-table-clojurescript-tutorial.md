# Light Table ClojureScript tutorial

Idea: Connect to the user plugin project, open an anonymous editor set it's syntax to clojurescript and then people should be good to go \(might still refer to David Nolans LT cljs tutorial\). Needs basic eval and display result intro of course. 

_**Gotta try to get this really easy to get started with.**_
