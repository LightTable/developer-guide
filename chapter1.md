# Getting Started

Developing on and extending Light Table can be done pretty much entirely using Light Table itself. Most changes, even when developing new features, can be performed runtime without the need to do any restarts. When you work with Light Table you'll find that you'll be using the REPL and the inline evaluation features available quite a lot. The exploratory nature of using a REPL will allow you to familiarize yourself gradually and incrementally with how things work. It's a truly interactive way of doing development and we trust you will find it very productive.
